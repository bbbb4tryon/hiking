You can then enter one of the three actions: "add", "delete", or "update".

If you enter "add", you will be prompted to enter the generic name and function of the clothing. Once you enter these values, a new Clothing object will be created and added to the database.

If you enter "delete", you will be prompted to enter the ID of the clothing to delete. If the clothing exists in the database, it will be deleted.

If you enter "update", you will be prompted to enter the ID of the clothing to update, and then the new function for the clothing. If the clothing exists in the database, its function will be updated.

After each action is completed, the program will return you to the main prompt and wait for your next action. If you enter any other input, the program will exit.
